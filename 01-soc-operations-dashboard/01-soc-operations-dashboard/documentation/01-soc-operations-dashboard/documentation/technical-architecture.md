# Technical Architecture: SOC Dashboard Suite

## System Overview

The SOC Operations Dashboard Suite is built on Splunk Enterprise platform with Enterprise Security, providing a scalable, high-performance security monitoring solution that demonstrates advanced certified Splunk implementation expertise.

## Architecture Components

### Data Layer Architecture

**Data Sources:**
- **Windows Security Events:** 4624 (Logon), 4625 (Failed Logon), 4648 (Explicit Logon), 4672 (Admin Rights)
- **Network Firewall Logs:** Allow/Deny decisions, traffic volume analysis, geo-location data
- **Web Server Access Logs:** IIS, Apache, Nginx with response codes and user agents
- **DNS Query Logs:** Requests, responses, anomaly detection, malicious domain identification
- **Endpoint Detection Response (EDR):** Process execution, file modifications, registry changes

**Data Processing Pipeline:**
- **Universal Forwarders:** Lightweight agents for log collection from endpoints
- **Heavy Forwarders:** Data preprocessing, filtering, and initial parsing
- **Indexer Clusters:** Distributed indexing with replication factor of 3
- **Search Head Clusters:** Load balancing for concurrent user access

### Application Layer

**Splunk Apps and Add-ons:**
- **Splunk Enterprise Security (ES)** - Core SIEM functionality
- **Splunk Common Information Model (CIM)** - Data normalization
- **Custom SOC Operations App** - Tailored dashboards and workflows
- **Splunk Mobile** - Responsive framework for mobile access

**Dashboard Architecture:**
- **Executive Overview** - High-level KPIs and security posture metrics
- **Analyst Workbench** - Real-time threat detection and investigation tools
- **Operational Metrics** - Team performance and system health monitoring
- **Incident Response** - Case management and workflow automation

## Data Flow Architecture

### Ingestion Pipeline
1. **Collection:** Universal Forwarders collect logs from 500+ endpoints
2. **Transportation:** SSL-encrypted transmission to indexers (TCP 9997)
3. **Processing:** Real-time parsing, field extraction, CIM normalization
4. **Storage:** Hot/Warm/Cold tiered storage with 90-day hot retention
5. **Search:** Distributed search across indexer clusters
6. **Presentation:** Real-time dashboard rendering and visualization

### Search Optimization Strategy

**Performance Optimization Techniques:**
- **Summary Indexing:** Pre-calculated metrics for frequently accessed data
- **Data Model Acceleration:** CIM-compliant models for fast pivot searches
- **Search Macros:** Reusable components for consistent search logic
- **Time-based Optimization:** Appropriate time windows (15min, 1hr, 24hr, 30d)

**Advanced SPL Implementation:**
```spl
| tstats summariesonly=true count as event_count, 
  dc(src_ip) as unique_sources, 
  dc(dest_ip) as unique_destinations 
  from datamodel=Network_Traffic 
  where earliest=-24h@h latest=now 
  by _time span=1h, action
| eval threat_score = case(
    event_count > 10000 AND unique_sources < 10, 90,
    event_count > 5000 AND unique_destinations > 1000, 75,
    1=1, (event_count/1000) + (unique_sources/10)
  )
